<sub>*COV19* - Simple mechanical ventilator to help coronavirus victims </sub>

Ventilator designed by our engineer team and partners, with the aim of helping to save lives during the pandemic of the corona virus.

Our goal was to create a simple, inexpensive lung ventilator that can be reproduced on a scale by other people, in order to assist in the treatment of corona virus patients.

It should be noted that, although we have worked in the industrial automation sector for several years and have obtained
guidance and help from various health professionals, we do not have expertise in medical equipment and therefore,
functionalities or adjustments in the current project may be necessary.

This documentation and the project repository can be used without limitations. Our goal with this project is to help save lives.
