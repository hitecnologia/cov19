        <h3>Presentation</h3>

        <p>Lung ventilator designed by the engineering team of HI Tecnologia and 
           Jacques Design, with the objective of helping to combat the pandemic 
           of the corona virus COVID-19.</p>

        <p>Our goal was to create a simple, inexpensive pulmonary ventilator 
           (estimated cost below US$100) and that can be reproduced on a scale, 
           by those who have availability, in order to assist in the treatment 
           of the sick of COVID-19.</p>

        <p>It should be noted that, although we have worked in the industrial 
           automation sector for several years and have obtained some guidance 
           and help from healthcare professionals, we do not have expertise 
           in medical equipments and therefore, functionalities or adjustments 
           in the current project may be necessary. 
           Help in this regard is welcome.<p>

        <p> All documentation and the repository for this project can be used 
            without restrictions. The project is not yet fully completed and we 
            continue to work on this process. As long as there are people 
            interested in this project, our engineering team will be 
            supporting it for free.</p>

        <p>Our only objective with this work is to contribute to minimize 
           the loss of life due to this epidemic.</p>

        <p>Our most sincere thanks to all the people who have helped 
           us in this process.</p>

        <h3>Current development status</h3>

        <p>This work started on 03/23/2020, and the initial version of the 
           mechanical design made available, reflects the 6th prototype developed.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Concept - Finished</li>
            <li>Mechanical design - Finished (version 1.0)</li>
            <li>Electronic project - Functional prototype available, 
                in the process of detailing the board</li>
            <li>Firmware design - Functional (version 1.0) Note: We may need to 
                add more features to the stepper motor driver</li>
            <li>Application design - Implemented a basic application for 
                functional tests, an operating interface need to be developed.  
                The <a href="https://www.hitecnologia.com.br/blog/histudio-novo-ambiente-de-programa%C3%A7%C3%A3o-para-clps-da-hi-tecnologia/"> 
                development environment (HIstudio)</a> already has support for 
                programming this hardware. You need to download the version available in
                <a href="https://github.com/hitecnologia/cov19/tree/master/project/application">Application project.</a> 
                The application was developed in ST languague. (structure text).</li>
